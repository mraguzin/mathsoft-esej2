abstract = {The Quicksort sorting algorithm and its best variants are presented and analyzed. Results are derived which make it possible to obtain exact formulas describing the total expected running time of particular implementations on real computers of Quicksort and an improvement called the median-of-three modification. Detailed analysis of the effect of an implementation technique called loop unwrapping is presented. The paper is intended not only to present results of direct practical utility, but also to illustrate the intriguing mathematics which arises in the complete analysis of this important algorithm.},

abstract = {The methods currently in use and previously proposed for the choice of a root in minimal storage tree sorting are in reality methods for making inefficient statistical estimates of the median of the sequence to be sorted. By making efficient use of the information in a random sample chosen during input of the sequence to be sorted, significant improvements over ordinary minimal storage tree sorting can be made.A procedure is proposed which is a generalization of minimal storage tree sorting and which has the following three properties: (a) There is a significant improvement (over ordinary minimal storage tree sorting) in the expected number of comparisons required to sort the input sequence. (b) The procedure is statistically insensitive to bias in the input sequence. (c) The expected number of comparisons required by the procedure approaches (slowly) the information-theoretic lower bound on the number of comparisons required. The procedure is, therefore, “asymptotically optimal.”},

By referring to what is known about OB school texts, we show that this text is most probably a school exercise by a trainee scribe who got the approximation from a coefficient list. These coefficient lists are briefly described, with their use in geometrical problems. We consider other texts involving square roots and derive an algorithm for evaluating them, which complies with all known OB examples, from a simple geometrical construction of the type that seems to underlie many other OB procedures.Copyright 1998 Academic Press. Nous considérons plusieurs aspects du rôle et de l'évaluation de l'approximation à quatre places sexagésimales de2sur cette tablette paléo-babylonienne. En nous référant à l'état des connaissances quant aux textes scolaires paléo-babyloniens, nous montrons comment ce texte est très probablement un exercice scolaire exécuté par un apprenti scribe qui a obtenu l'approximation à partir d'une liste de coéfficients. Nous décrivons en bref ces listes de coéfficients, ainsi que leur utilisation dans les problèmes de géométrie. Nous considérons d'autres textes traitant de racines carrées , et pour les évaluer nous dérivons un algorithme qui est en accord avec tous les exemples paléo-babyloniens connus; ceci à partir d'une construction géométrique simple du type qui semble être charactéristique de beaucoup d'autres procédures paléo-babyloniennes.Copyright 1998 Academic Press.
