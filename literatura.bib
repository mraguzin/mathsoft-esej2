The method compares very favourably with other known methods in speed, in economy of storage, and in ease of programming. Certain refinements of the method, which may be useful in the optimization of inner loops, are described in the second part of the paper.}",

abstract = {The Quicksort sorting algorithm and its best variants are presented and analyzed. Results are derived which make it possible to obtain exact formulas describing the total expected running time of particular implementations on real computers of Quicksort and an improvement called the median-of-three modification. Detailed analysis of the effect of an implementation technique called loop unwrapping is presented. The paper is intended not only to present results of direct practical utility, but also to illustrate the intriguing mathematics which arises in the complete analysis of this important algorithm.},

abstract = {The methods currently in use and previously proposed for the choice of a root in minimal storage tree sorting are in reality methods for making inefficient statistical estimates of the median of the sequence to be sorted. By making efficient use of the information in a random sample chosen during input of the sequence to be sorted, significant improvements over ordinary minimal storage tree sorting can be made.A procedure is proposed which is a generalization of minimal storage tree sorting and which has the following three properties: (a) There is a significant improvement (over ordinary minimal storage tree sorting) in the expected number of comparisons required to sort the input sequence. (b) The procedure is statistically insensitive to bias in the input sequence. (c) The expected number of comparisons required by the procedure approaches (slowly) the information-theoretic lower bound on the number of comparisons required. The procedure is, therefore, “asymptotically optimal.”},
